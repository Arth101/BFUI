## Introduction
This is a fan project that tries to recreate the Battlefield 1 UI with web technologies. The main menu UI elements are more or less exact derivatives from the games menu but some of the residing UI elements has been imagined in the vision of Battlefield 1's design. The design is made to be responsive and work across desktop, tablet, and mobile as well.

## Getting Started
Download or clone this repo. You can work forward using the index.html in `example/` that I've made, or you can just import the stylesheet to your own project. I would recommend taking a look at my `example/` to get an idea of the layout required for some elements (primarily the sidebar).

## Usage

Development:
```css
<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
Production:
```css
<link href="style.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

You can also use the CDN:
```css
